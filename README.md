# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction – Edunet Internship Project

This repository contains the complete work done by **Aryan Singh** during a 6-week **AICTE–Edunet Foundation Internship on AI & ML**, powered by **IBM SkillsBuild**. The project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a machine learning web application focused on predicting employee salaries based on multiple input attributes. It covers all essential phases including data preprocessing, model training, deployment, and final project packaging.
